	htop computes the entropy of braids.
======================================================

To compile, you should first install from www.shoup.net 
a version of NTL, for instance ntl-5.4, and compile it.

Then place the ntl directory inside the htop directory 
and type "make" in a shell.

Customization should be rather easy, since the makefile 
is very symple.

The htop command computes the entropy of braids written
with usual generators. To get help type "htop" alone.

NB: htop is not htop
